# Simple BMI Calculator in Python

This repository contains a basic command-line Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented in Python. It takes the user's weight in kilograms and height in meters as input and calculates their BMI, then categorizes it according to common BMI ranges.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `bmi_calculator.py`).
2.  **Run from the terminal:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python bmi_calculator.py
    ```
3.  **Enter your details:** The script will prompt you to enter your weight in kilograms and your height in meters. Provide the numerical values and press Enter after each.
4.  **View your BMI and category:** The script will calculate your BMI, display the result formatted to two decimal places, and then provide a corresponding BMI category.

## Features

* **Simple command-line interface:** Easy to use with basic terminal input.
* **Input validation:** Includes basic error handling to ensure the user enters numerical values for weight and height, and that these values are positive.
* **Clear output:** Displays the calculated BMI and the corresponding BMI category.
* **Standard BMI calculation:** Uses the widely accepted formula: `BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)`.
* **BMI categorization:** Provides a classification based on the calculated BMI value.

## Getting Started

No special installation is required to run this script, as long as you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your terminal.
